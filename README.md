# home_management_system
Use Google AI Studio to create a home management system with AI and Docker.

Okay, that sounds like a fantastic project! It's ambitious, but definitely achievable, and a great way to put your Python skills and Docker knowledge to use. We'll start with the core functionality of tracking tasks and then layer on the more advanced features later.

Let's break down how we'll approach this, keeping Docker and Docker Compose in mind for future deployment:

**Phase 1: Core Task Management (Focus on Python & Basic Docker)**

1.  **Data Structures:** We'll start by defining how to represent tasks in Python. We'll need to handle different task types and attributes like due dates, recurring frequency, and completion status. We can use Python's built-in data structures, like dictionaries and lists, to get started. We will use a simple, human readable data storage method (JSON)

2.  **Core Logic:** We'll create functions to add, modify, delete, and list tasks.
    *   We'll also need functions to manage each type of task (e.g. seasonal, one-time, recurring)

3.  **Basic CLI Interface:** To interact with our task manager, we'll build a basic command-line interface (CLI) using Python's `argparse` module. This will allow you to add tasks, view tasks, mark them complete, etc.

4.  **Basic Docker Setup:** We'll containerize the basic app, to get a better understanding of best practices.

5.  **Version control:** We will use Git for version control.

**Phase 2: Enhancement (Focus on Docker Compose, APIs, and Databases)**

1.  **Persistence:** We will switch from storing data in JSON to a persistent data store.

2.  **Web Interface:** We'll introduce a simple web interface using Flask or FastAPI to interact with the tasks. This is where docker compose will come in.

3.  **User Manual Data:** We'll start exploring how to structure and store user manual data for the appliance feature.

4.  **Reminders:** We will explore ways to send reminders for upcoming tasks.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Focus on Docker Compose, Microservices)**

1.  **Microservices:** Explore breaking the application into microservices (e.g. reminder service, task management service, manual reader service)

2.  **Advanced Deployment:** Explore deploying to cloud or other infrastructure.

**Let's Start with Phase 1**

**Step 1: Setting up your Project and Version Control**

First, let's create a directory for your project and set up a Git repository:

```bash
mkdir home_management_system
cd home_management_system
git init
```

**Step 2: Creating your base python script**

Create a file named `task_manager.py` and place the following base script in the file.



**Explanation:**

*   **Imports:** We import `json` for handling the task data as JSON, `argparse` for building the command-line interface, and `datetime` for handling dates.
*   **`load_tasks()` and `save_tasks()`:** These functions handle loading and saving the tasks from a JSON file named `tasks.json`. If the file does not exist, it will return an empty tasks object.
*   **`add_task()`:** This function creates a task and adds it to the appropriate list.
*   **`list_tasks()`:** This function lists the tasks of a given type.
*   **`mark_complete()`:** This function marks a task as complete by its index.
*    **`mark_incomplete()`:** This function marks a task as incomplete by its index.
*   **`delete_task()`:** This function deletes a task by its index.
*   **`main()`:** This is the main function, which sets up the `argparse` parser and based on the supplied commands and arguments, calls the apporpriate functions.

**Step 3: First Commit**

Before we proceed, let's make our first commit:

```bash
git add task_manager.py
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added basic CLI task manager"
```

**Step 4: Run the Script**

Now, let's run your script with some commands.

Add a task:
```bash
python task_manager.py add one_time_tasks "Get Groceries" --due 2024-07-20
```

Add a reoccurring task:
```bash
python task_manager.py add recurring_tasks "Take out the trash" --recurrence weekly
```

Add a seasonal task:
```bash
python task_manager.py add seasonal_tasks "Change over winter tires" --season fall
```

List tasks:
```bash
python task_manager.py list one_time_tasks
python task_manager.py list recurring_tasks
python task_manager.py list seasonal_tasks
```

Mark a task as complete
```bash
python task_manager.py complete one_time_tasks 1
```

Mark a task as incomplete
```bash
python task_manager.py incomplete one_time_tasks 1
```

Delete a task:
```bash
python task_manager.py delete one_time_tasks 1
```

You should see your tasks being added to `tasks.json` file and be able to interact with the tasks.

**Next Steps:**

*   Let me know how this works.
*   We will then move on to using docker to package up our application.
*   We can then work on the persistence layer (databases).

How does this look? Are you ready to move on to the next step, or would you like to explore any of these aspects in more detail?


That sounds great! I'm glad you're on board with the approach. Creating a GitHub repository is an excellent step for collaboration, version control, and sharing your project. I am also happy that you are reviewing the code.

**Next Steps**

Okay, let's continue with our plans. Now that we have a basic working CLI application and you have set up your GitHub repository, we'll move onto containerizing it.

**Step 1: Creating a `Dockerfile`**

1.  In the root of your project directory (where `task_manager.py` is located), create a new file named `Dockerfile` (no extension).

2.  Add the following content to the `Dockerfile`:

    ```dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.11-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Make task_manager.py executable
    RUN chmod +x task_manager.py

    # Define the command to run your application
    CMD ["python", "task_manager.py"]
    ```

**Explanation**

*   **`FROM python:3.11-slim`:** This line specifies the base image we are using: a slimmed down version of Python 3.11.
*   **`WORKDIR /app`:** Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
*   **`COPY . /app`:** Copies all files from the current directory (where the Dockerfile is) into the `/app` directory inside the container.
*   **`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`:** This line installs the required Python packages based on a `requirements.txt` file (which we will create shortly). The `--no-cache-dir` flag ensures that pip doesn't cache downloads inside of the container and helps reduce the container image size.
*   **`RUN chmod +x task_manager.py`**: This makes the `task_manager.py` executable, since there are some cases where that may not be true.
*   **`CMD ["python", "task_manager.py"]`:**  Specifies the command that will be executed when the container starts.

**Step 2: Creating a `requirements.txt` file**

We don't actually have any external dependencies at the moment, since everything is using built in python libraries, but creating a `requirements.txt` file is best practice for python. In the root of your project directory, create a `requirements.txt` file and add the following to it.

```text
#No dependencies as of yet
```

**Step 3: Building the Docker Image**

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the root of your project directory.
2.  Run the following command to build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t home-management-system:v1 .
    ```

    *   **`docker build`:** This is the Docker command to build an image.
    *   **`-t home-management-system:v1`:** This tags the image with the name `home-management-system` and tag `v1`.  We will use this tag to manage different image versions.
    *   **`.`:** Specifies that the Dockerfile is located in the current directory.

    Docker will now build your image! You should see the steps from the Dockerfile being executed in your console window.

**Step 4: Running the Docker Container**

1.  Once the image is built, you can run a container using:

    ```bash
    docker run home-management-system:v1
    ```

    *   **`docker run`:** This is the Docker command to run a container.
    *   **`home-management-system:v1`:** This is the name and tag of the image you want to run.

    You'll notice that nothing happened. This is because we need to pass arguments to the python application. So let's do that:

    ```bash
    docker run home-management-system:v1 add one_time_tasks "Test the docker image" --due 2024-07-30
    ```

    You should see the task add to the `tasks.json` file in the docker container.

    **NOTE:** Since the `tasks.json` is local to the docker container, you wont see it added to the local repository unless you copy it over from the docker container using `docker cp`.

**Step 5: Commit Changes**

Let's commit these changes to Git:

```bash
git add Dockerfile requirements.txt
git commit -m "Added Dockerfile and requirements.txt"
```

**Troubleshooting**

*   **Image Build Issues**: Review the output from `docker build`. Look for errors, and correct them in the Dockerfile.
*   **Container Errors**: If the container exits right away, you can use the command `docker run --rm -it home-management-system:v1 /bin/bash` and then run the commands manually. This will give you an interactive bash shell so you can explore the container.
*   **Version Issues:** Make sure you have an up to date version of Docker Desktop

**Next Steps**

Let me know how this goes!

*   Are you able to successfully build and run the docker image?
*   Did you encounter any problems?

Once you have the docker image working, we can then move on to using databases for our task management system.
